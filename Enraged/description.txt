Bosses now become enraged during battles. Various factors contribute to causing this effect. Rage state is temporary, but can be devastating if unprepared. Effects include:
* High resistance to damage.
* Intimidation aura: Causes screen to shake.
* Evil residue: A trail of bramble-like tiles that ensnare players and cause damage. These brambles resist attacks and are hard to pickax, but will fade over time. Beware your boss arenas!

Configurable.
