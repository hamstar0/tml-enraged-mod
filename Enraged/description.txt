Bosses now become enraged during battles. Various factors contribute to causing this effect. Rage state is temporary, but can be devastating if unprepared. Effects include:
* Increased attack and movement speed.
* High resistance to damage.
* Intimidation aura: Causes screen to shake.
* Evil residue: A trail of bramble-like tiles that ensnare players and cause damage. These brambles resist attacks and can't easily be pickaxed, but will fade over time. With bad luck, their position may render any boss arena unusable until removed.

Configurable.
