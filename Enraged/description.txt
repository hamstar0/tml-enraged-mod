Bosses now become enraged during battles. Various factors contribute to causing this effect. Rage state is temporary, but can be devastating if unprepared. Effects include:
* Increased attack and movement speed.
* High resistance to damage.
* Intimidation aura: Causes screen to shake.
* Evil residue: A trail of bramble-like tiles that resist attacks, can't easily be pickaxed, but fade over time. With bad luck, may render boss arenas unusable until dissipation.

Configurable.
